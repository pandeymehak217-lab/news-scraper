Video appears to show mistakenly released hotel asylum seeker in Chelmsford

Police are continuing a manhunt for an asylum seeker who was mistakenly released from prison on Friday, weeks after being jailed for sexually assaulting a schoolgirl in Essex. Ethiopian national Hadush Kebatu was meant to be sent to an immigration detention centre from HMP Chelmsford ahead of a planned deportation on Friday but Justice Secretary David Lammy said the 41-year-old is now ""at large"" in London. Lammy said officers from the Metropolitan Police, British Transport Police (BTP) and Essex Police were working together to trace Kebatu, who was jailed for 12 months in September. Sir Keir Starmer described the release as ""totally unacceptable"".

The prime minister said Kebatu ""must be caught and deported for his crimes"", adding that police are ""working urgently to track him down"". Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said the release was a ""level of incompetence that beggars belief"". ""Conservatives voted against Labour's prisoner release program because it was putting predators back on our streets,"" she said on X.

Essex Police Hadush Kebatu posed a ""significant risk of reoffending"", the judge said during sentencing

The Prison Service has removed an officer from discharging duties while an investigation takes place. Essex Police said Kebatu boarded a London-bound train at Chelmsford station at 12:41 on Friday. The force said it was informed by the prison services about ""an error"" at 12:57 on Friday. A statement continued: ""We understand the concern the public would have regarding this situation and can assure you we have officers working to urgently locate and detain him."" Lammy said he was ""appalled"" and ""livid on behalf of the public"". He continued: ""Let's be clear Kebatu committed a nasty sexual assault involving a young child and a woman. And for those reasons this of course is very serious."" A Prison Service spokesperson said: ""We are urgently working with police to return an offender to custody following a release in error at HMP Chelmsford. ""Public protection is our top priority, and we have launched an investigation into this incident."" It is not clear where Kebatu was being deported to but under the UK Borders Act 2007, a deportation order must be made where a foreign national has been convicted of an offence and has received a custodial sentence of at least 12 months.

Kebatu's arrest in July sparked protests outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, where he had been living after arriving in the UK on a small boat. In September, Chelmsford Magistrates' Court heard Kebatu tried to kiss a teenage girl on a bench and made numerous sexually explicit comments. The following day, he encountered the same girl and tried to kiss her before sexually assaulting her. He also sexually assaulted a woman who had offered to help him draft a CV to find work. During the trial, Kebatu gave his date of birth as December 1986, making him 38, but court records suggested he was 41. He was found guilty of five offences and sentenced to 12 months. He was also given a five-year sexual harm prevention order, which banned him from approaching or contacting any female, and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for 10 years. The court heard it was his ""firm wish"" to be deported. In his sentencing remarks on 23 September, District Judge Christopher Williams said the time Kebatu had already spent in custody during his trial would count towards his sentence. The judge added: ""You will also be subject to an early release regime. The earliest date of your release will be calculated and you will be notified of this.""

The USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, can carry up to 90 aircraft

Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of ""fabricating a war"", after it sent the world's largest warship towards the Caribbean in a major escalation of its military build-up in the region. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, which can carry up to 90 aircraft, to move from the Mediterranean on Friday. ""They are fabricating a new eternal war,"" Maduro told state media. ""They promised they would never again get involved in a war, and they are fabricating a war."" The US has been increasing its military presence in the Caribbean, sending warships, a nuclear submarine and F-35 aircraft in what it says is a campaign to target drug traffickers.

It has also carried out ten airstrikes on boats it says belong to traffickers, including one on Friday when Hegseth said ""six male narco-terrorists"" had been killed. That operation took place in the Caribbean Sea, against a ship Hegseth said belonged to the Tren de Aragua criminal organisation. The strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. The Trump administration says it is conducting a war on drug trafficking, but it has also been accused by both experts and members of Congress of launching an intimidation campaign in an effort to destabilise Maduro's government. Maduro is a longtime foe of Trump, and the US president has accused him of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation which he denies. ANALYSIS: What's Trump's endgame in Venezuela? ""This is about regime change. They're probably not going to invade, the hope is this is about signalling,"" Dr Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House think tank, told the BBC. He argued the military build-up is intended to ""strike fear"" in the hearts of the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle so that they move against him. In its Friday announcement, the Pentagon said the USS Gerald R Ford carrier would deploy to the US Southern Command area of responsibility, which includes Central America and South America as well as the Caribbean. The additional forces ""will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle TCOs"", or transnational criminal organisations, spokesman Sean Parnell said.

Watch: The US is ""fabricating an eternal war"", says Nicolás Maduro

The carrier's deployment would provide the resources to start conducting strikes against targets on the ground. Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of what he called ""land action"" in Venezuela. ""We are certainly looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,"" he said earlier this week. It comes as CNN reports Trump is considering targeting cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela, but is yet to make a final decision. The aircraft carrier last publicly transmitted its location three days ago off the coast of Croatia, in the Adriatic Sea. Its deployment marks a significant escalation in the US military buildup in the region. It is also likely to increase tensions with Venezuela, whose government Washington has long accused of harbouring drug traffickers. The carrier's large aircraft load can include jets and planes for transport and reconnaissance. Its first long-term deployment was in 2023. It is unclear which vessels will accompany it when it moves to the region, but it can operate as part of a strike group that includes destroyers carrying missiles and other equipment. The US has carried out a series of strikes on boats in recent weeks, in what President Donald Trump has described as an effort to curtail drug trafficking.

Metropolitan Police Jake Reeves, left, was brought into the plot by Dylan Earl

Six men have been jailed for their parts in a Russian-ordered arson attack on a London warehouse providing aid to Ukraine. The fire at industrial units in Leyton, east London, on 20 March 2024 caused £1.3m in damage. Ringleader Dylan Earl was recruited by the Wagner Group, a mercenary organisation that acts on behalf of the Russian state and is proscribed by the UK government as a terrorist organisation. He was sentenced to 17 years in prison plus a further six years on extended licence. Before his arrest, he was also plotting to kidnap a wealthy Russian dissident.

Earl, 21, from Elmesthorpe, Leicestershire, admitted a National Security Act offence and aggravated arson, along with Jake Reeves, 24, from Croydon, who was given 12 years in prison plus one year on extended licence. Reeves helped Earl recruit a group of men to carry out the arson. The pair are the first to be convicted of offences under the National Security Act 2023. The act is designed to tackle threats that fall short of traditional spying and can involve third party actors not working directly for a hostile state, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) says. Of the other four men sentenced: Nii Mensah, 23, from Thornton Heath, who streamed the attack, was convicted of aggravated arson and jailed for nine years

jailed for nine years Ashton Evans, 20, from Newport, pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply Class A drugs, convicted for failing to tell police what he knew about a planned kidnapping, and jailed for nine years.

Jakeem Rose, 23, from Croydon, who set the buildings alight, pleaded guilty to have a bladed article in a public place, convicted of aggravated arson and jailed for eight years and 10 months

Ugnius Asmena, 21, of no fixed address, who arranged the getaway car and was there on the night, was convicted of aggravated arson and jailed for seven years All four each received a further year on extended licence.

Earl contacted the Wagner Group on messaging app Telegram and told his handler he was keen to carry out a series of ""missions"", of which Leyton would be the first, the court previously heard. In the chat, Earl's contact instructed him to watch Cold War spy drama The Americans and use it as a ""manual"". Earl then brought in other men to carry out the arson attack. The Ukrainian-owned warehouse they targeted had been used to send goods to Ukraine, including Starlink satellite terminals, and it required eight fire crews with 60 firefighters to get the blaze under control. Earl was supposed to receive £9,000 for his role but was paid less because he carried out the plan early without his handler's sign-off. On Friday, Judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb described the case as a ""planned campaign of terrorism and sabotage"" in the interests of the Russian state.

After the warehouse attack, Earl and Reeves set the group's sights on an arson attack on a restaurant and wine shop in Mayfair and the kidnap of owner Evgeny Chichvarkin, a critic of the Russian state. But before he could carry it out, he was arrested in a B&Q car park in Leicestershire, and videos of the warehouse fire being started were found on his phone. In a search of the drug dealer's home, police recovered a Russian flag, more than £20,000 in cash and cocaine with a street value of some £34,000. Evidence on his phone revealed details of a cryptocurrency account holding more than £58,000 and images of bundles of cash estimated to total £175,000. Earl also admitted possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and possession of criminal property.

Getty Images Cash Isas allow people to save up to £20,000 without paying tax on the interest

Chancellor Rachel Reeves should not cut the cash Isa tax-free allowance in the upcoming Budget, a group of MPs has strongly advised. Cuts to the tax-free allowance were unlikely to have the intended effect of promoting an investment culture in the UK, the Treasury Select Committee said in a report. Reeves is expected to announce tax rises or spending cuts in next month's Budget, and is reportedly considering changes to cash Isas. The chancellor said: ""My understanding is that the report says that changes to Isas shouldn't be made in isolation of other policies. I'll be setting out any tax changes in the budget in November. And of course we need to get that balance right.""

Reeves added: ""At the moment, often returns on savings and returns on pensions are lower than in comparable countries around the world, and I do want to make sure that when people put something aside for the future, they get good returns on those savings.""

Earlier this year, the chancellor was thought to be mulling a reduction to the allowance for tax-free cash savings in a bid to encourage people to put money into stocks and shares instead and boost the economy. Those plans were put on hold after strong opposition from banks, building societies and consumer campaigners. Savers can put up to £20,000 a year in Isas in savings and investments, to protect the returns from being taxed. The chancellor has said she intends to keep this limit in place, and it can currently be spread across products including cash Isas and stocks and shares Isas. The proposed change specifically relates to cash Isas, and earlier this month the Financial Times reported the chancellor was considering reducing their tax-free amount to £10,000. The purpose behind this would be to encourage investment. The chancellor is facing a Budget shortfall of about £22bn, according to a recent estimate. She is expected to raise taxes or cut spending in her November Budget in order to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules of not borrowing to fund day-to-day spending and to get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament. Cash Isas are the most widely used type of Isa. A total of £360bn is held in cash Isas across the country. The committee's report concluded that ""cutting the cash Isa allowance is unlikely to incentivise people to invest their cash in stocks and shares"". Chair of the Treasury Select Committee, Dame Meg Hillier, said: ""This is not the right time to cut the cash Isa limit."" ""The Committee is firmly behind the chancellor's ambition to create a culture in the UK where savers are sensibly investing their money and getting better returns through well-informed financial decisions,"" she said. ""But we are a long way from that point.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yp57peqw8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

BBC Three year-old Zain Tafesh died from leukemia earlier this week

So many lives in Gaza still hang in the balance. In different wards of Nasser Hospital lie two 10-year-old boys, one shot by Israeli fire and paralysed from the neck down, another with a brain tumour. Now that a fragile ceasefire is in place, they are among some 15,000 patients who the World Health Organization (WHO) says are in need of urgent medical evacuations.

Amar Abu Said is paralysed from the neck and needs specialist treatment

Ola Abu Said sits gently stroking the hair of her son Amar. His family says he was in their tent in southern Gaza when he was hit by a stray bullet fired by an Israeli drone. It is lodged between two of his vertebrae, leaving him paralysed. ""He needs surgery urgently,"" Ola says, ""but it's complicated. Doctors told us it could cause his death, a stroke or brain hemorrhage. He needs surgery in a well-equipped place."" Right now, Gaza is anything but that. After two years of war, its hospitals have been left in a critical state.

Ahmed al-Jadd and his sister Shahd lost their father in the war

Sitting by the bedside of her younger brother, Ahmed al-Jadd, his sister Shahd says her brother was a constant comfort to her through two years of war and displacement. ""He's only 10 and when our situation got so bad, he used to go out and sell water to help bring some money for us,"" she says. A few months ago, he showed the first signs of ill health. ""Ahmad's mouth started drooping to one side,"" Shahd explains. ""One time he kept telling me: ""Shahd my head hurts"" and we just gave him paracetamol, but later, his right hand stopped moving."" The one-time university student is desperate for her brother to travel abroad to have his tumour removed. ""We can't lose him. We already lost our father, our home and our dreams,"" Shahd says. ""When the ceasefire happened it gave us a bit of a hope that maybe there was a 1% chance that Ahmed could travel and get treated.""

Reuters International agencies are desperate to increase the number of evacuations

On Wednesday, the WHO coordinated the first medical convoy to exit Gaza since the fragile ceasefire began on 10 October. It took 41 patients and 145 carers to hospitals abroad via Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing, with ambulances and buses taking the group on to Jordan. Some have stayed for care there. The UN agency has called for numbers of medical evacuations to be rapidly increased to deal with the thousands of cases of sick and wounded. It wants to be able to bring out patients through Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt as it has done previously. However, Israel has said it is keeping the crossing closed until Hamas ""fulfils"" its commitments under the terms of the Gaza ceasefire deal by returning the bodies of deceased hostages. Israel has kept the Gaza side of the Egyptian border closed since May 2024 when it took control during the war. Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, the head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said ""the most impactful measure"" would be if Israel could allow Gazan patients to be treated in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as happened before the war. Top EU officials and foreign ministers of more than 20 countries - including the UK - have previously called for this, offering ""financial contributions, provision of medical staff or equipment needed.""

BBC Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly's last edition of Strictly will air on Christmas Day

Strictly stars are gearing up for the contest's annual Icons Week, days after presenters Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman shocked fans by announcing they'll be leaving the show. In a joint statement on Thursday, the pair said they were ""always going to leave together and now feels like the right time"". The duo will step down at the end of the current series, with the Christmas special set to be their last show. Some have speculated the pair may say more about their departure during Saturday's live show. Earlier this week, Winkleman said: ""It's best to leave a party before you're fully ready to go.""

On Friday, Deadline reported that Winkleman is in advanced talks to host her own chat show. The BBC has not commented. There's also no hint yet from the BBC on who might take over from Winkleman and Daly on Strictly, and it could be several months before replacements are signed up. Commentators have been speculating about who would be the right fit for the show and whether it should be a well-established presenter or an up-and-coming star. Producers could perhaps look to bring in a current or former presenter from sister show, Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two. The show is currently hosted by singer Fleur East, who participated in Strictly Come Dancing in 2022, and professional dancer Janette Manrara. Broadcaster Rylan Clark also hosted the spin-off for four years and Radio 2 presenter Zoe Ball hosted it for 10 years.

Fleur East has been presenting Strictly: It Takes Two for the last two years and could be in the mix as a replacement host

Some bookmakers have named The One Show's Roman Kemp as their favourite for the Strictly job - with Coral cutting their odds. Actress Hannah Waddingham, Big Brother co-host AJ Odudu, former Strictly winner Stacey Dooley and Celebrity Traitors' breakout star Alan Carr are among the other names being mooted. Ladbrokes is also offering odds on Holly Willoughby as a surprise frontrunner, with another ITV star, Alison Hammond also on their list. Whether BBC bosses want to recruit from within the organisation or look to poach stars from rivals remains to be seen. Caroline Frost, TV editor of the Radio Times, described Daly and Winkleman as ""a formidable presenting duo"". Asked if their departure could potentially mean an end to the show, the TV critic told BBC Breakfast there was no need to ""throw the baby out with the bath water"" and that ""a rebrand"" was more likely. ""It still draws in millions of viewers,"" she said of Strictly. ""It's only bad compared with those extraordinary, phenomenal ratings earlier in its reign. ""But certainly it will be like other programmes we've seen before, Doctor Who, Match of the Day, MasterChef; they've all had opportunities for a rebrand... so this could be one of those shows.""

Amber Davies and Nikita Kuzmin will dance the Cha Cha Cha to Break Free by Ariana Grande

On Saturday evening's show, the 11 remaining couples will take to the ballroom floor to honour music icons from across the decades, with songs by Beyoncé, Harry Styles and Ariana Grande in the mix. On Sunday night, Hollywood actress Rachel Zegler will also make a guest appearance, performing Don't Cry For Me Argentina in the results show. But Neighbours star Stefan Dennis will no longer appear after he withdrew from the contest due to injury.

'The end of an era'

Tess Daly began presenting Strictly alongside Sir Bruce Forsyth 21 years ago, while Winkleman joined as a main presenter in 2014. In a joint statement on Thursday, they said: ""We have loved working as a duo and hosting Strictly has been an absolute dream."" Daly and Winkleman have fronted the hit BBC show as it has faced a string of controversies in recent years, relating to the behaviour of some of its professional dancers and celebrity guests. The BBC's chief content officer, Kate Phillips, called it ""the end of an era"", and described the pair as ""incredible hosts"".

Here's who is dancing on Saturday night - and to what:

Alex and Johannes - Foxtrot to Here You Come Again by Dolly Parton

Amber and Nikita - Cha Cha Cha to Break Free by Ariana Grande

Saturday's episode will see the professional dancers recreate several of Britney Spears's most famous looks

Away from the Tess and Claudia news, the show goes on - with the couples performing routines to songs from their favourite music heroes on Saturday night. Icons week was introduced last year, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Strictly. The other special weeks in Strictly are: Movies, Halloween, Blackpool and Musicals. The judges will also be in costume as different icons, but fans will have to watch to find out exactly who they're dressed as. They will provide their scores before audiences get to vote and have their say. Doctor Who actress Alex Kingston topped the leaderboard last week with 36 points and, more importantly, was dubbed a ""queen"" by head judge Shirley Ballas who awarded her a perfect 10 for her Rumba. Earlier this week, Dennis - who was partnered with professional Dianne Buswell, issued a statement saying he had torn his calf ""so significantly"" that he had been forced to pull out of the competition. When I met the Australian actor backstage ahead of the first live show, he told me his main reason for taking part was so he could take his wife out dancing. And in his statement, he insisted he would still be able to do that.

Magnesium: Can this 'miracle mineral' really help us sleep?,,,"Magnesium: Can this 'miracle mineral' really help us sleep?

It's been described as the mineral of the moment. Millions of us are taking magnesium for a whole range of reasons. Can it help us sleep better? Sort our digestion problems? Give our busy brains a moment of peace? In the fast-moving world of supplements, it's magnesium's time to shine. And the industry is booming. The global magnesium market is worth nearly £3bn and that's set to nearly double over the next decade. In a small factory, nestled in the Yorkshire Dales, huge plastic barrels of white powder are stacked up next to giant whirring machines. Workers in hazmat suits carefully weigh out magnesium citrate - a compound made by mixing the mineral with citric acid - into shiny, steel containers.

Ruth Clegg/BBC Millions of magnesium tablets are produced in this factory every day

""We are sending our supplies all over the world,"" Andrew Goring, manager director of Lonsdale Health, explains. ""Around the UK, obviously, but also to Australia, parts of Asia, Kuwait, Iraq. ""It's one of our biggest sellers and the market just keeps growing."" He is shouting over the hum of the pill presser, a machine that resembles a Dalek, which pops out dozens of small white magnesium tablets a second. ""Do we actually need it?"" I bellow back. ""And why now, why has it become so popular?"" ""Influencers, social media - that's what's pushing it,"" Mr Goring explains. ""We've known about magnesium and its benefits for years and now, finally, it's mainstream."" I can almost hear the eye roll when I contact Kirsten Jackson, a dietitian who specialises in gut health. ""Clever marketing schemes,"" Ms Jackson says, ""magnesium is involved in areas people are willing to invest in: their sleep, digestion, mental health."" But, she is keen to stress, this does not automatically mean we need supplements to improve those things.

Magnesium is one of several minerals in our bodies. The recommended daily amount for women is 270mg and for men, it's 300mg. We store about 25g. It might make up less than 1% of us but ""it is involved in over 300 different processes"", Ms Jackson explains. It is ""especially important for our brain and mood,"" she says, because it helps nerves send messages properly and supports the building blocks of brain cell membranes. It also helps balance blood sugar levels, regulate blood pressure, and is an essential player in moving calcium and potassium in and out of our cells, which maintains the rhythm of our heartbeat. So, surely popping a pill full of the stuff should keep our bodies running smoothly? It's more complex than that, says Ms Jackson. For a magnesium supplement to work, we need to be lacking the mineral in the first place - and it's difficult to test for any deficiency because the vast majority of our magnesium is stored in our bones and tissues. But on an individual level, many say the supplement has made a difference.

Katie Curran Katie says magnesium supplements have helped improve her sleep and calmed her racing thoughts

For Katie Curran, a communications specialist who has worked with some of the biggest fashion brands, sleeping well was something she could only dream about. ""A year ago, I was struggling,"" she confides. ""It would take so long to get to sleep, my brain was racing, and then I would get off only to wake a couple of hours later."" Katie decided to try magnesium glycinate - a combination of magnesium and glycine, an amino acid with limited evidence linking it to better sleep. After two weeks of taking 270mg a day, she says the noise in her head started to quieten. The racing thoughts slowed down, and she began to feel like she could function again. ""My sleep definitely improved, I had more energy. I became more active. Other things changed in my life, so I can't put it down to just one thing, but I think the magnesium supplements were an important part of the puzzle."" While being deficient in magnesium can definitely affect sleep patterns, there isn't the evidence to say taking supplements will definitely improve your sleep.

Social media is awash with eager supplement-takers, many with posts stamped with ""commission paid"" in the corner - meaning they could earn money from their story or reel. According to these influencers, it feels as though there is little magnesium can't help with, as they recommend a variety of different products. Magnesium is often mixed with other compounds with the aim of helping support various parts of our bodies. For example, magnesium mixed with either L-threonate or glycinate is supposed to target brain health, which helps with sleep and stress relief. If magnesium is combined with chloride, it is recommended for muscle tension and pre-menstrual cramps, while citrate and oxide blends are aimed at digestion and help with constipation. The majority of us can probably relate to having at least one of those issues. But as nutritionist Kristen Stavridis stresses, the problem is there is not enough strong evidence to show the majority of these different magnesium supplements have a positive effect on the healthy population. And even if they did - we would need to be deficient in magnesium in the first place to see a benefit. ""We have supplement companies shouting out at us: 'We are all going to die',"" Ms Stavridis says, ""'Quick! Take my pill and - hey presto - there's your solution'. ""Many of us are not getting enough magnesium,"" she continues, ""around 10% of men and 20% of women are not getting the recommended daily intake. ""But just taking a supplement is not the answer.""

Caitlin Graham Caitlin wanted to learn in an automatic car, but was forced to learn manual

Caitlin Graham wanted to learn to drive in an automatic car as she hoped the test would be quicker to pass without having to get to grips with a gear box. But the 22-year-old says she had little choice but to learn in a manual due to any available automatic instructors being more than 20 miles away. Motorists have seen a quiet shift in how they drive in recent years - with one in three cars on UK roads now an automatic. A quarter of driving tests in England, Scotland and Wales last year were taken in automatic cars. The AA says the trend is being driven by the UK's ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars coming in 2030, as elecric cars do not have manual gearboxes. For new drivers, this presents a dilemma - whether to learn and take their test in an automatic or a manual car.

Boxed in

It is a decision that could affect the rest of their driving lives - pass your test in an automatic and you will forever be boxed into only driving automatics - or indeed electric vehicles. Pass in a manual, and you will have the freedom to pick and choose. But many young people say it is not a decision they are freely able to make. Some would-be automatic learners have complained about a lack of instructors and the higher cost of lessons. Others feel the jeopardy of learning in a manual is just too high. With huge competition for driving test slots, and long waits to re-take for those who fail, some young drivers feel learning in an automatic is the only way out of the fail-rebook, fail-rebook doom loop.

When Caitlin moved back home to a ""super rural"" part of Cumbria after university she was eager to pass her driving test as quickly as possible. There is no public transport in her village and she wanted to get on with finding a job. But unable to get hold of an automatic instructor she went for manual and passed almost a year after her first lesson. She says it only took her sister, who learned to drive in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, five months to pass in an automatic. But it is a common misconception that the automatic test is easier - the pass rate for the manual test is higher at 50.4% than automatic at 43.9%, according to Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) figures for the financial year ending 2025. ""People still need to make the right decisions at the right time - make the correct observations at the right time and drive at appropriate speeds,"" says Stewart Lochrie, chairman of the Approved Driving Instructors National Joint Council (ADIJC).

Cleo Moseley Cleo was anxious to pass her test first time

Cleo Moseley really weighed up the decision. ""Automatic felt like the slightly easier option"" but ""manual lessons were cheaper,"" she says. Automatic and electric cars tend to cost more to buy than manuals so instructors charge more to cover this, adds Stewart from the ADIJC. For the same reason Cleo says: ""I also didn't know if I would be able to afford an automatic car at the end."" The 25-year-old from Northumberland has decided to start learning in a manual. ""I did really think about it,"" she says. ""Automatic cars are basically becoming the norm. But I don't see manual cars [being] the majority five, 10, 15 years from now, so I don't think everyone should learn manual.""

Luke Breaban-Cook Luke passed his driving test in a manual

For Luke Breaban-Cook the decision was pretty much made for him - he has just passed his test after learning in his parents' manuals. ""They were the only cars available to me,"" says the 18-year-old from Battle in East Sussex. ""I didn't want to get my own car as it was too expensive,"" he adds. ""Plus I'm moving to London for uni and I'm not planning on driving there."" Luke found clutch control difficult at first. ""I stalled once in my test,"" he says, but he still passed first time. Luke does nott think every learner should do a manual test: ""Even if there is a chance that you might have to drive a manual courtesy car or rental car, that chance is getting smaller and smaller.""

David Robinson David is dyspraxic and thought an automatic would be easier for him

For some people with disabilities automatic cars can be more accessible. David Robinson, who's 29 and from Cardiff, booked his driving test in September and has to wait until February to take it. He opted to learn in an automatic because he has dyspraxia, which affects movement and coordination. ""It just seemed like a better idea because I didn't want to have to balance the clutch, the brake, the accelerator, check the revs, make sure I'm getting into the right gear,"" he says. David hasn't ruled out getting a manual licence in future, but he says he would wait and see what happens after the ban on new petrol and electric cars takes effect in 2030. ""It might be that in five years I don't see the point,"" he says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wgpr40jeno?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

Britney Spears stared at herself in a mirror, grinning as she grabbed an electric clipper. Chunks of her long, iconic locks fell to the floor of the Southern California salon. Paparazzi cameras outside documented every second of the now-infamous night in 2007, later following her with her new buzzcut to get a tattoo. The star said she did it because she felt cornered and humiliated by the paparazzi, who had chased her from the house of her estranged husband, Kevin Federline. In the midst of an acrimonious and widely publicised custody battle for their two young boys, the Princess of Pop said she acted out in defiance and wanted to give the press ""some material"". She called it an impulsive decision - one that to her, served as a public rebuke to a world she felt held her to untenable standards. To her, it was a ""desperate move by a desperate person"". But to her estranged husband, it was a wake-up call to ""just how far things had spiralled out of control"".

Decades later, those moments and the others that went on to define the pop star and her very public unravelling are back in the limelight - but what exactly happened and why depends on who is doing the retelling. After Spears shared her outlook in her 2023 memoir, The Woman In Me, Federline is now speaking out and sharing his take on their years together in a book released this week, titled You Thought You Knew. Like Spears, Federline's book details their intimate and chaotic relationship, the mental anguish they both suffered and provides an inside glimpse at the conservatorship battle that dictated much of Spears' life and career. It provides a side-by-side look, a he-said, she-said dissection of their lives.

The Grammy Award winner, 43, has already denounced her ex's memoir, writing on social media that Federline's revelations have been ""extremely hurtful and exhausting"". But the dancer-turned-reality TV star says he's releasing You Thought You Knew after years of hesitation because he does not want his children growing up ""feeling like they have to explain who their father is"". Federline responds to the stories and accusations that Spears tells in her 2023 tome, in which she describes being financially and emotionally controlled by those closest to her. He contradicts her account at times, levying fresh accusations. Despite both memoirs offering vastly different accounts at times, both have a similar aim in reframing the public narrative thrust upon them by illuminating the episodes that led to Spears' conservatorship battle, as well as the nationwide movement that freed the pop star in 2021.

Did the conservatorship help or hurt?

In her book, Spears condemned the court-ordered conservatorship, also known as a guardianship, which she was under from 2008-2021. During that time, her father, Jamie Spears, was in control of her finances, career and many aspects of her personal life. She says that if she was just left to live her life, she would have worked it out. ""Thirteen years went by with me feeling like a shadow of myself. I think back now on my father and his associates having control over my body and my money for that long and it makes me feel sick,"" she wrote. But, she added, she resolved to go along with the protracted arrangement ""for the sake of my sons,"" even though ""being in it was really hard"". After the conservatorship ended, her father Jamie Spears said it had been ""necessary"" to protect her, but it was time for her to have control back. In his recounting, Federline has a different take. Even when the marriage tanked, it wasn't easy for him to ""watch her spiral"", he writes. Federline supported the arrangement, arguing that it provided ""some semblance of normalcy"" for their two boys together. After her psychiatric hold, Federline says he immediately filed for sole custody, but that set into motion a slew of issues that exacerbated Spears' relationship with their children. His ex, he writes ""saw the events in her life through a prism that painted her as the victim, the misunderstood one, the person wronged by everyone around her. ""But from where I stood, she needed help. Whether that was rehab or therapy, I couldn't say for sure,"" he writes, noting that she was in no state to manage her own affairs and needed some form of oversight or ""protective layer"". He adds that he came to find out that there was a lot he didn't know about the conservatorship, and he did not push for answers because part of him ""doesn't want to know"".

Did the Free Britney movement get it 'wrong'?

Spears has credited the viral Free Britney movement with helping her find the courage to challenge and eventually escape her conservatorship. ""The fact that my friends and my fans sensed what was happening and did all that for me, that's a debt I can never repay,"" she wrote, thanking them for standing up for her when she couldn't stand up for herself. But Federline says the movement ""got it wrong"" and those who are part of it now need to put the same effort into a ""Save Britney movement"". He shares ominous concerns about how the pop star is currently ""racing toward something irreversible"" and ""getting close to the 11th hour"". The pressure from the Free Britney movement, he alleges, led the judge on her conservatorship case ""to ignore the professional reports and cave to public opinion"". ""But none of that truly mattered in the end. If Britney believed she was being held against her will, and everything else she's shared since, then that trauma is real for her. And you can't ignore that,"" he says. Spears has continued to make headlines with strange and sometimes concerning posts on Instagram. Their boys are grown up but, according to Federline, they have haven't seen their mother much, and they don't really want to. Federline has four additional children, along with the two with Spears. Federline says he has lost faith that things will ever fully turn around for his ex-wife. ""I still hope that Britney can find peace. Whatever her future holds, I hope it's one where she can finally take control of her own life, on her own terms. This whole saga, twenty years of it, was built on denial. Britney never reached the first step of recovery: admitting there was a problem.""

AFP Spears has said she felt constantly cornered by paparazzi cameras that followed and dissected her life

A ghost in their marriage

Spears has laid blame on many people who were once close to her, including two of her exes, Federline and former NSYNC frontman Justin Timberlake. She accuses both of ruining her ability to ""trust people again"". In his own memoir, Federline says he was making a career for himself as a professional dancer who worked with Michael Jackson and NSYNC when he crossed paths with Spears. The couple had met before, when Federline was dancing on a tour for Spears' opening act. Federline, for his part, is self-aware, writing that he knows people viewed the Fresno, California, native as ""this dude jumped out of his trailer and into Britney's mansion"". But even the day before their wedding, there was a shadow over the relationship, he says. Federline contends in his book that when he and Spears got together in their early 20s, she had never really moved on from her ex-boyfriend Timberlake, detailing that they had a lot of ""unfinished business"" and that ""it lingered, like a ghost in the background of our relationship"". In her memoir, Spears recounted the pitfalls of her relationship with Timberlake, including him asking her to have an abortion and the public embarrassment that befell her after he accused her of cheating - further heightened when he cast a Spears lookalike in his music video for Cry Me a River.

Frank Trapper via Getty Images Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake were the globe's most famous celebrity couple.

Their relationship, which lasted from 1999 to 2002, has also been dissected over the years and has come with a public apology from Timberlake, after several documentaries about Spears recast her as a victim in her conservatorship. Federline says that ""there was always something there with Justin that she couldn't let go of"". He says Spears even called Timberlake the night before their wedding to get closure. ""Now, looking back... I realise it was deeper than that. She never really got over him,"" he writes.

Re-igniting an old feud and an army of fans

Federline's memoir has raised the ire of Spears, and her vocal army of online supporters. James Miller, an activist and Free Britney proponent, says the book will not help the singer. ""Britney does struggle with mental health problems, that's pretty obvious,"" he told the BBC. ""Exploiting her right now really isn't the best time. I don't think there's any alarm to sound.""

Michael Buckner via Getty Images Fans protested outside the courthouse as Spears fought to be freed from her conservatorship

From breaking out on The Mickey Mouse Club as a child star to dancing with a snake around her shoulders at the MTV Music Video Awards, Spears has lived her whole adult life in the spotlight. S Mark Young, a professor at the University of Southern California and author of The Mirror Effect: How Celebrity Narcissism is Seducing America, says Federline's book is unlikely to change people's minds about her. ""I think after this coming week, the book will die. Most people who follow Britney will not be moved,"" he says. Some have wondered why Federline, 47, has chosen to speak out now. ""No one heals when a book like this is written,"" Mr Young says. Mr Miller, and many online, have noted that now that their sons are both over 18, Federline would no longer be receiving a $40,000-per-month payment from the singer to support them. Federline denies having an ulterior motive beyond wanting to finally share his side of this infamous saga.

Coco Sarel Sarel is best known for her Love Island debriefs after each episode

When Sarel presses record on her phone, there's no script, no set and no meticulous plan for what she's about to say. ""I'm usually wearing my bonnet, no makeup and I just pick up the phone and start yapping,"" she says. ""I believe in maximum output for minimal effort, so if I have to do more than the bare minimum, I likely won't do it. That's why I just talk to the camera and post."" In only a few years, Sarel's unfiltered style has turned her from an ordinary voice online into one of TikTok's most distinctive personalities, with more than one million followers on the platform. Famous for her Love Island debriefs, Sarel is among the nominees at the second annual TikTok awards - a celebration of the creators shaping online culture in the UK. There are 72 nominees across 12 categories including education, beauty, comedy, food and sport. The nominees have a combined following of more than 83 million followers. From breakout comedians to beauty innovators, this year's nominees include jacket potato entrepreneurs, tap dancing brothers, a bus loving aunty, a BookTok aficionado and a film location fangirl.

Coco Sarel

Sarel can't quite believe that the thing she does most naturally - talking - has gained her millions of followers and likes. ""It's mad people want to watch me yap,"" she says. But the simplicity of her process is part of the appeal and ""you really do see 100% of me on the camera"". Her journey has also taken her beyond the screen, and in 2023 she performed at the Edinburgh Fringe festival with fellow TikTok stars. ""I've got a whole new respect for comedians after doing that,"" she says. ""With content, if people don't like it, they scroll away, but if you bomb on stage, the whole room is looking at you like, 'That's terrible'"". With visibility comes scrutiny, and Sarel says it's not always easy dealing with the darker side of social media. ""The hate is always louder than the love,"" she says. ""Five years ago, I'd clap back in the comments, but I'm 31 now and I'm too tired for that so I just block it out and ignore it."" Because she started sharing later in life, Sarel is still figuring out how much of herself to put online. ""I go off how I feel in the moment, and my audience respects that,"" she says. ""I started off like I was just talking to friends, but now I protect parts of my life I don't want everyone's opinion on."" While social media is full of people turning major life events into months-long content strategies, Sarel isn't interested in that and even significant milestones tend to pass with little fanfare on her feed. ""I recently got married and I did two videos, then I was like, 'Let's talk about The Traitors.' I've got ADHD, so I move on quickly.""

Henry Rowley

Henry Rowley The 27-year-old was a marketing executive before finding fame on TikTok

Best known for his ""husky posh girl"" sketches, Henry Rowley has become one of TikTok's sharpest comedy voices. The Leicester-born performer discovered his now signature characters while studying at Bristol University, where he found himself ""surrounded by a whole new world of posh"" and he couldn't resist turning it into material. ""Some of those posh people were my friends and I found everything they said hilarious, so I started making videos about things they'd say on nights out."" His sketches, which more recently include impressions of Harry Potter characters as if they were Scottish, has earned him more than a million followers on TikTok.

He's also tried to carve a space in stand-up - a move he admits has been challenging. ""It's entirely different doing content and comedy on stage,"" he says. ""Stand-up takes a lot of work and before the Fringe and my tour, there were so many pubs and awful gigs where I did a 20-minute set to zero laughs. It's certainly humbling."" Despite his rising profile, Rowley protects much of his life from the public eye. ""I mainly post characters and sketches so people who follow me don't know that much about me, which is really nice. I like having that balance,"" he says. His advice for other people starting out creating content is similar to what most of the nominees said: ""Don't try and go viral but instead focus on doing something you are genuinely interested in.""

The mental health nurse has become one of TikTok's most unexpected success stories and she admits ""it's slightly overwhelming that everyone recognises me"". ""I get recognised in the streets sometimes and people say, 'Oh, hello, Bus Aunty.' I never thought people would be stopping me in my wildest dreams and it's taken some getting used to."" ""To be nominated is amazing,"" she says of her TikTok Awards nod. ""If I'm nominated, it means I deserve to be here, and I really do love buses and love London and hopefully that shows."" She's also proud to represent a different side of the app's community. ""You're never too old,"" she says firmly. ""I would never have thought I could do TikTok and be nominated for awards, but here I am, having only posted for just over a year. ""Never give up on your dream because what I love about London has got me here.""

BBC Let there be light - a therapeutic lamp can counter the darkness indoors on short days

As the clocks go back and the darkness draws in, spare a thought for those living with the longest nights in the UK. In the depths of winter, Scotland's northern isles will see barely six hours of daylight from morning till night. In London and the south, people will have about two more hours of light than islanders in Orkney and Shetland. During these shorter days more than a million people in the UK experience symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder (Sad), according to the Royal College of Psychiatry. These can include lowered mood, emotional difficulties and feelings of anxiety.

What is Seasonal Affective Disorder?

Sad is a recurring seasonal depression, common in winter, that is typically brought on by shorter days with reduced hours of daylight.

It was identified in the early 1980s by Prof Norman Rosenthal, a South African psychiatrist working in the United States, who began using light therapy as a treatment.

Symptoms of Sad described by the NHS can include low mood, irritability, a loss of interest in everyday activities and feeling sleepy during the day.

Sufferers can also have feelings of despair, guilt and worthlessness, have difficulty concentrating and a decreased sex drive.

Life in remote locations, in the countryside or on islands, can be particularly challenging in the darker months, says Professor Hester Parr. She leads the 'Living with Sad' project at the University of Glasgow. ""People with Sad routinely feel very depressed and sluggish,"" she told BBC Scotland News. ""They find it difficult to socialise because they just don't have the energy and motivation at this time of year. ""We work with those people to provide creative and cultural resources to encourage a more outdoor life, and give tips to build new 'light routines'.""

Using a winter sky frame to focus on seasonal changes in the clouds

Prof Parr points out that people in rural communities often have limited access to social and medical support to help them through winter. So for the first time this year, islanders on Orkney are being offered therapeutic lamps to help them cope with Sad and counter the effects of low light. These will be handed out from libraries as part of 'Wintering Well' boxes. The lamps come alongside an activity guide and tools to help people develop a routine for good mental health when daylight is in short supply. Prof Parr says: ""We're pitching our resources at an attitudinal shift, a psychological mind-shift towards winter. ""So that we get out and enjoy winter, no matter what the weather. ""We've put that into a book and a CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) course in partnership with a psychiatrist."" Tools in the box include a winter sky frame. It's a simple cardboard cut-out, that people are encouraged to hold for 10 minutes to observe a small patch of sky, to help lift their mood.

University of Glasgow Prof Hester Parr (right) launched the pilot project with librarians in East Dunbartonshire

Prof Parr says the UK can also learn from Scandinavian nations where there is ""a different cultural attitude to winter"". She says creating an interior light environment that is cosy and comforting can help people cope with Sad. ""We tend to walk into winter thinking it is going to be one long dark season and that's not actually true. ""If we do go outside there are large amounts of daylight available that does help our mental health. ""But it is not just about going outside and getting light, it is about redesigning our interior spaces. ""Using natural light through windows, but also using candles and fun lights to make the winter spaces in our homes more welcoming.""

Why are nights longer in the north?

The winter solstice is the shortest day of the year in the UK - with the fewest hours of daylight and longest night. This year it falls on 21 December.

In northern Scotland the sun rises later and sets much earlier than southern England based on the Earth's tilt away from the Sun

On the winter solstice the difference is more than two hours of daylight between the most northern and southern parts of the UK.

On 21 December at Penzance in Cornwall, the sun will rise at 08:18 and set at 16:21. That's eight hours and three minutes of daylight.

In Lerwick in Shetland it will rise at 09:08 and set at 14:57 - just five hours and 49 minutes of daylight.

The Orkney scheme is the next step in a project that was piloted in East Dunbartonshire in Scotland last winter. It's a joint project from the universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, funded by UKRI (UK Innovation and Research). About 100 Wintering Well boxes were made available, which were borrowed more than 200 times and renewed 349 times. Orkney Library's mobile van - known as Booky McBookface - will help distribute the light lamps across the islands.

How to cope with the long winter nights when the clocks go back

Former librarian Stewart Bain, now a presenter on Radio Orkney, says the boxes will be welcomed by locals. He says there is ""no denying it can be a dark place"" as the clocks go back. ""It's getting to that stage that its dark when I'm going into work, dark when I'm coming home,"" he says. ""Come the depths of winter it'll be dark after three, at four o'clock pitch black. ""The lack of sunshine combined by the lack of exercise I think can have an impact. ""I think it definitely affects my mood. One of the key things for mental health is being able to get outside for a walk.""

Counting is due to get under way later in the Irish presidential election. Voters in the Republic of Ireland went to the polls on Friday to elect the 10th Irish president, who will replace current head of state Michael D Higgins. There are two contenders to become the next president, but voters had a choice of three candidates - Catherine Connolly, Heather Humphreys and Jim Gavin, whose withdrawal from the race came too late to have his name removed from the ballot paper. Ballot boxes will open at 09.00 local time on Saturday and the result is due to be announced at Dublin Castle later that evening.

Early unofficial indications have suggested the turnout could potentially struggle to reach the record low of just under 40% recorded in the last presidential election in 2018. Connolly is an independent politician backed by a number of left-wing parties including Sinn Féin. She has been a TD (member of parliament) since 2016 and previously worked as a psychologist and barrister. She is from Galway. Humphreys is the Fine Gael candidate. She was a TD from 2011 to 2024 and served in a number of senior cabinet ministerial positions, including social protection and justice. She comes from a Protestant background and is from Monaghan. The votes, which will be counted in each of the 43 constituencies, will be tallied by political parties as soon as boxes open and these will give early indications of the result.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lqmmp2lg2o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

The fallout after a former asylum seeker who sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl was mistakenly released from prison dominates Saturday's papers. The Sun calls the blunder ""one out... by mistake"", playing off the government's ""one in, one out"" asylum scheme. The paper reports Ethiopian national Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu was due to be deported before being released after an ""astonishing error"" by prison staff.

The Daily Telegraph says police are scrambling to track down the sex offender who was let out of HMP Chelmsford after being wrongly categorised as a prisoner due to be freed. Justice Secretary David Lammy says he is ""furious"" and has ordered an ""urgent investigation"" into the error, the paper reports. Elsewhere, a picture of Boris Johnson's ex-wife Marina Wheeler is front and centre, who poses the question ""I'm over him, surely Britain is too?""

""A blunder that beggars belief"" is the Daily Mail's take. Police say Kebatu was last seen asking for directions from locals before boarding a London-bound train at Chelmsford station on Friday, the paper reports. Sharing the front page, the Mail says that Prince Andrew could be asked to leave the Royal Lodge by King Charles III.

The Mirror also leads with Prince Andrew's ""advanced talks"" with the King to leave the Royal Lodge after the fallout from his links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. ""Dislodged"" is the paper's headline over an aerial view of Windsor's sprawling Royal Lodge mansion.

A ""stark warning for Starmer"" after Labour suffered a ""crushing"" by-election defeat in its traditional heartland of Wales on Friday, the Guardian reports. The paper says the result highlighted the ""striking collapse"" of the party's vote, with MPs warning a repeat loss in the 2026 May local elections ""could spell the end"" of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's premiership. Alongside, the Guardian previews Claudia Winkleman's ""next steps"" after she and fellow Strictly Come Dancing host Tess Daly announced they were leaving the show.

""Starmer in firing line"" echoes the Independent's headline on the government's ""historic by-election defeat"" in Caerphilly. The paper reports the PM saying he was ""deeply disappointed"" with the result. Also sharing the top spot is the King's ""royal welcome"" for Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday ahead of a summit with European allies in London.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing to give more than a million low-paid workers a pay boost in the budget, the Times reports. The paper says Reeves has been warned by businesses the move would risk ""pricing jobs out of existence"".

The i follows with more warnings from economists for the chancellor, who say raising the higher rate of income tax would hit ""ordinary workers"", including teachers and junior doctors. The paper reports Reeves is considering ""breaking Labour's manifesto pledge to give herself some breathing space on public spending"".

""Trump sets off fresh tariffs alarm"" is the Financial Times' lead, after Donald Trump ""cleared the way for new tariffs"" on China and halted trade talks with Canada on Friday. The paper says the decisions come ahead of Trump's upcoming trip to Asia, which includes a summit in South Korea with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Finally, the Daily Star is asking their readers who they want as Strictly Come Dancing's next hosts. The top names in the running include presenters Rylan Clark and Zoe Ball, with ""Lettuce Liz Truss"" also making a surge with 8% of the vote.

Many papers feature the Epping asylum seeker jailed for sexual assault who has been released from prison by mistake.

The Daily Telegraph calls it a ""jail blunder"", with the Daily Mail saying the error ""beggars belief"".

The Times quotes the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accusing Labour of ""putting predators back on the streets"", and highlights Sir Keir Starmer's response on X in which he said he was ""appalled by the mistake"".

Prince Andrew still features prominently in many newspapers.

The Guardian is among those reporting that he is in advanced talks with Buckingham Palace about leaving his 30-room mansion, Royal Lodge, as pressure grows following fresh revelations about him in the posthumous memoirs of Virgina Guiffre.

""Dislodged,"" says the Daily Mirror's headline. Prince Andrew has consistently denied claims by Ms Guiffre that he sexually abused her.

The Times reports that the Chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing to give more than a million low paid workers a pay rise in next month's budget by increasing the national living wage.

But the paper says economists and the hospitality industry have warned it could lead to job losses and it quotes the Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, Simon Roberts, saying it could result in price rises for shoppers.

Labour is planning to let trade unions ""barge"" into workplaces under the new employment rights bill, according to documents seen by the Daily Telegraph. It says a Department of Business and Trade consultation paper states employers with more than 21 workers will face big fines if they block access to officials.

A spokesman for the department says it is not true that the bill would allow unions to turn up when they wanted.

And a pledge by the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, to abolish business rates for a quarter of a million retailers is the main story for the Daily Express.

It says the promise - part of a four-pronged plan - will kickstart a High Street boom if the party were in power to implement it. Labour says it is also creating a fairer business rates system.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg51v6d9qn8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

More than 20 nations supporting Ukraine have pledged to ""take Russian oil and gas off the global market"" as part of efforts to pressure President Vladimir Putin to end the war. ""We're choking off funding for Russia's war machine,"" said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, after hosting a summit of the so-called ""coalition of the willing"" in London. The UK and US have in recent days sanctioned Russia's two biggest oil companies, while the EU targeted Moscow's liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was also in London, said ""pressure"" on Russia was the only way to stop the fighting. However, no long-range missile deliveries were announced at the summit.

Zelensky has long argued that US-made Tomahawks and European missiles would help make the war costs heavier for Moscow by hitting key military targets – including oil refineries and weapons depots – deep inside Russia. But during last week's talks in Washington, US President Donald Trump indicated to Zelensky that he was not ready to supply Tomahawks. On Thursday, Putin warned that if ""such weapons are used to strike Russian Federation territory the response will be... overwhelming"". Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 and currently controls around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula that it annexed in 2014.

Speaking at a joint press conference after the London summit, Sir Keir said Putin was ""not serious about peace"", and therefore Ukraine's allies agreed a ""clear plan for the rest of the year"" on supporting Ukraine. The UK prime minister said this also included targeting Russia's sovereign assets to ""unlock billions to help finance Ukraine's defence"". He gave no further details. On Thursday, EU leaders agreed to help support Ukraine's ""financial needs"" for the next two years - but stopped short of agreeing to use frozen Russian assets worth €140bn (£122bn). Asked about a so-called ""reparations loan"" for Ukraine funded by the Russian assets, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she hoped a decision would be made by Christmas Eve. In London, the ""coalition of the willing"" also pledged to strengthen Ukraine's air defences"" amid almost daily Russian air assaults on Ukrainian civilians and energy infrastructure. Zelensky warned that Russia ""wants to make the winter cold a tool of torment"", adding: ""They want to break us."" Comments by the leaders in London will be disappointing for those who were hoping to hear specific examples of how Kyiv's allies were planning to prevent Russia from attacking Ukraine. No doubt, a lot of the words said will be pleasing to the Ukrainian ear. For example, Sir Keir said the UK and Ukraine's other allies were prepared to ratchet up pressure on Moscow. But there were no concrete examples of how exactly the allies were planning to force a change on the battlefield or force Putin to the negotiating table.

Rachel Reeves refuses to rule out income tax rises at Budget,,,"Reeves refuses to rule out income tax rises in Budget

Chancellor Rachel Reeves has refused to rule out an income tax rise in next month's Budget, amid speculation she is considering breaking a key Labour election pledge. Asked about reports, first published in The Guardian newspaper, that the Treasury is in active discussions over raising the rate, Reeves said she would ""continue to support working people by keeping their taxes as low as possible"". Reeves' refusal to rule out a rise does not mean one is inevitable as Chancellors rarely confirm or deny specific tax measures ahead of a Budget. But her careful language contrasts with comments in September that ""manifesto commitments stand"" on not raising income tax, National Insurance or VAT.

Labour's 2024 general election manifesto contained a pledge not to raise ""the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax"". The party also promised not to increase National Insurance - prompting a row last autumn when it announced a hike in the contributions paid by employers. Speaking to journalists in Leeds on Friday, Reeves said: ""Although I can't talk about individual measures at this stage, I understand that the cost of living is still people's number one concern."" She went on to say that her aim was to ""ensure that we continue to support working people by keeping their taxes as low as possible"" but that she was still ""going through the process"" of writing her Budget. She also said that although the inflation figures this week ""came in better than expected"" there was ""obviously much more to do.""

The chancellor has signalled she is likely to focus on wealthy individuals at the Budget, saying ""those with the broadest shoulders should pay their fair share"". This week, reports suggested officials are exploring a mix of measures, including higher taxes on partnerships used by lawyers and accountants. However, economists say such steps will not raise enough to close the hole in the government's finances, leaving Reeves under pressure to consider more politically sensitive options.

Influential think-tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says Reeves will ""almost certainly"" have to raise taxes to make up a £22bn shortfall in the government's finances. The gap has been driven by the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) decision to downgrade productivity forecasts, wiping out much of the £10bn ""headroom"" Reeves set aside at the spring statement. Government borrowing - the difference between public spending and tax income - in September rose to £20.2bn, the highest for that month in five years, according to the Office for National Statistics. The effective interest rates on UK government debt has fallen sharply, but Reeves has been left with very little room to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules without increasing taxes. These rules mean her plans must be projected to get government debt falling as a share of national income by 2029-30, and day-to-day government costs must be paid for by tax income rather than borrowing.

If Reeves increases income tax it will be the first rise in the rate since 2010, when Labour introduced a 50% additional rate on incomes over £150,000 which was reduced to 45% by the coalition government. Currently, Income tax is charged on earnings above the personal allowance of £12,570, which is tax-free. The basic rate of 20% applies to income between £12,571 and £50,270, while earnings from £50,271 to £125,140 are taxed at the higher rate of 40%. Income above £125,140 is subject to the additional rate of 45%. These thresholds apply to most taxpayers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, while Scotland has a separate system. The Guardian reported that Treasury officials are in ""active discussions"" about adding 1p to the basic rate of income tax, which could raise more than £8bn as well as looking at increasing higher rates for top earners. The basic rate of income tax has not been raised since the 1970s.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr4g89g1x8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss
Tanzania election: The fears that voting time brings for those with albinism,,,"Attacks on people like me happen every time my country has an election

BBC

Fresh trauma arrives with every election season in Tanzania for 42-year-old Mariam Staford. For most, the fiesta-like rallies and songs, along with the campaign messages, signal a chance for people to make their voice heard. But for those with albinism, they bring terror. Warning: This article contains details of graphic violence that some people may find upsetting ""The first thing that comes to me is fear,"" Mariam tells the BBC as people prepare to vote for a president and parliament on Wednesday. ""I know that killings of people with albinism happen especially at election time in Tanzania, when witchcraft beliefs intensify. That's why I don't take part in campaigns… I am so afraid."" Albinism, which affects an estimated 30,000 people in Tanzania, is a rare genetic condition that reduces melanin - the pigment that gives colour to skin, eyes and hair. Superstition has made those with the condition targets. The false belief that body parts of people with albinism bring wealth, luck, or political success have driven attacks and killings across Tanzania. Activists say such assaults intensify in the run-up to an election as people vie for political influence. Mariam knows what this danger looks and feels like personally. In 2008, one of the bloodiest years for people with albinism in Tanzania as preparations for local elections were under way, machete-wielding men stormed into her bedroom in Kagera, a north-western border region. ""They came at a late hour of the night, cut off my right hand [from above the elbow] and took it away, and then they also cut off my left hand. ""The next day I was taken to a dispensary, unconscious, and the doctor who saw me said: 'This person is already dead, take her back home and bury her'"". Against the odds, Mariam survived; but she was five months pregnant and her unborn child did not.

The attack not only left her with permanent disabilities but forced her to abandon Kagera, one of the epicentres of ritualistic killings of people with albinism at the time. She eventually resettled in the relative peace of Kilimanjaro region, where a rights group for people with albinism, Under the Same Sun, built her a house and trained her to use a knitting machine. She now makes sweaters. Seventeen years on, the trauma has not faded. ""Even now, I sometimes dream of that night,"" Mariam says. ""When I wake up, I touch my arms and remember they are not there. It is something I will never escape."" What happened to Miriam was one of scores of attacks targeting people with albinism and their body parts. Under The Same Sun says there have been 211 such incidents in Tanzania since 2008: 79 people have been killed

100 people were mutilated but survived

Three victims were not injured

Two people were abducted and remain missing

27 graves have been desecrated and body parts looted. In 2008 alone as many as 35 people with albinism were murdered, while many other deaths probably went unreported. Those killings drew global condemnation, prompting a government crackdown. The president at the time, Jakaya Kikwete, condemned the attacks and called for tough action against the killers. As a result, Tanzania stepped up investigations when it came to witchcraft-related killings of people with albinism and tightened laws against discrimination. There have also been attempts to raise public awareness about the issue. At a traffic roundabout in the town of Sengerema in the north-west, a monument has been built to commemorate the children, women and men with albinism who have lost their lives or were maimed in attacks. The life-size metal statue shows a father lifting a child with albinism onto his shoulders while the mother shields it from the sun. Mariam's name is carved in the monument. So is that of Mariamu Emmanuel, who was just five when she was killed in 2008.

Sitting at his home in Mwanza, her brother, Manyashi Emmannuel, now 25, recalls that day. The pain still haunts him. ""I was eight years old, and saw her legs, hands and tongue removed by the attackers. Ever since then, I have been scared. It is most difficult at times when we hear of attacks close to elections."" Despite the awareness campaigns, the attacks are still continuing. One has been recorded this year, in the north-western town of Simuyu, in June. The victim was unharmed but has now been moved to a safe house. President Samia Suluhu Hassan recently warned against what she called harmful traditional beliefs, saying they had no place in Tanzania's elections. Senyi Ngaga, a district commissioner of one of the areas prone to attacks, says government education campaigns have raised understanding, but rural areas remain vulnerable to superstitions as well as discrimination. She wants more involvement from everyone in the community to stop the attacks. ""We recently held a festival with traditional healers where we sat together and talked,"" the commissioner tells the BBC. ""As the election approaches, we also advised them to be good ambassadors to tell others to reject such acts and ensure that people with albinism are protected.""

A monument has been built to commemorate the people with albinism who've been attacked

While campaign groups and survivors say much more work still needs to be done by the government, some progress has been made. Awareness drives, civil society programmes, and school inclusion initiatives have helped reduce attacks in some areas. Communities are slowly beginning to understand that people with albinism are not cursed and that superstitions can have deadly consequences. But the murder last year of two-year-old Asimwe Novath, abducted from her home in Kagera region, was a reminder that the issue has not gone away. Witnesses said the toddler was taken by force by two unidentified men while she played with her mother. Seventeen days later, parts of Asimwe's body were found in a sack, discarded under a bridge in the same region. Her remains were later buried at her family home. Nine suspects have been charged with premeditated murder in connection with the killing, but the case has not concluded. For Mariam, the case brought up troubling memories. ""It took me back to my own night of attack back in 2008. I know that pain, and I know her mother will never forget it."" Her experience means that fear is part of her everyday life. She avoids crowds and rarely leaves home unaccompanied. As Wednesday's vote approaches, Mariam says she will not cast a ballot, sceptical about what difference it will make to her life. Instead, she will spend the day quietly at home in Kilimanjaro.

Bill Gates's cameo in iconic Indian TV drama with Smriti irani,,,"Why Bill Gates did a cameo in an iconic Indian TV drama

JioStar Bill Gates appeared on Thursday night's episode to talk about maternal and child health with Smriti Irani

A crossover no-one saw coming. That's how many in India are describing Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates's appearance in an iconic Hindi TV drama with actress and former federal minister Smriti Irani. Mr Gates appeared on Thursday night's episode of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi (Because the Mother-in-Law Was Also Once Daughter-in-Law) to talk about maternal and child health with Irani. The Gates Foundation has been working on curbing infant and maternal mortality for years with governments in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar - the two northern Indian states with huge populations that are also among the most disadvantaged regions. Government data shows a significant improvement in maternal and child health indicators over the years, including in the two states. But in a country steeped in patriarchy, challenges remain. In such a scenario, experts say messaging becomes extremely important to keep the drumbeat going to change norms and to make people more aware of the need to take care of their girls and mothers. And to do that, Mr Gates perhaps couldn't have chosen a better platform than Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi. First launched in July 2000, the series had a very successful long innings had a very successful long innings with several thousand episodes that were broadcast almost daily on Star Plus for eight- and-a-half years before it was discontinued, says Shailaja Bajpai, columnist and Readers' Editor for Print new site. In July, 25 years after it first hit the screens, Kyunki... returned for its second innings.

JioStar Bill Gates' unexpected cameo seems to have brought the show back into the limelight

Indian audiences found the show, based on the complex domestic relationship between Irani's character Tulsi and her mother-in-law, riveting. The trials and tribulations of the dutiful new bride had families reorganise their daily routines to ensure they didn't miss out a single episode. Irani's character was - and is - at the centre of this story of the fictitious Virani family. In the first season, she played a young woman who fell in love with and married the scion of a wealthy family. A quarter of a century later, Tulsi is middle aged, her children are all grown up and she is about to become a ma-in-law herself. But the battles she's fighting now are still with jealous and misguided family members and the drama - and the melodrama - of the original season remain in abundance, Ms Bajpai says. ""If you take away the gadgets, the mobile phones and the laptops, essentially remove all the window dressing, it's still the same story. It's just been updated."" But, she adds that one thing that's different now is that the social messaging has increased. ""I think that's because it fits her profile more. She served as the minister for women and child development so the show now talks about divorce, child and maternal health and other socially-relevant issues."" The four-minute-long segment with Mr Gates starts with the Microsoft founder greeting her in American-accented Hindi - ""Namaste Tulsi-ji,"" he says, asking her if he'd said it right? ""Yes, absolutely perfect,"" she beams. The call comes after Tulsi is seen in a viral video at a godh-bharai (baby shower) dishing out health advice to an expectant mother. Tulsi's son, who's posted the video, tells her that he had tagged Mr Gates, wondering if he'd be willing to talk to Tulsi on a video call. ""He's accepted,"" he squeals with delight. Tulsi initially seems a bit nervous. ""What will I say to him? I only do video calls with you all or your father about grocery shopping,"" she says.

Chief prosecutor says top official would not call China an enemy,,,"Chief prosecutor says top official would not call China an enemy

PA Media Stephen Parkinson has broken his silence ahead of a committee appearance

The director of public prosecutions has said the China spy case collapsed because a top national security official could not say the country had been classed as an ""enemy"" when the Conservatives were in power. In a letter to MPs, Stephen Parkinson said the unwillingness of Deputy National Security Adviser Matt Collins to say that China had been an active threat to national security between 2021 and 2023 was ""fatal to the case"". Mr Parkinson has been under pressure to explain why two men were charged with spying only for the case against them to collapse 16 months later without going to trial. A political blame game erupted over the case - but the focus has now switched to the role of officials. And government witnesses are expected to query some of the DPP's written evidence when they appear before the parliamentary committee next week.

In April 2024, Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry were charged under the Official Secrets Act 1911 over allegations that they had passed information to a Chinese intelligence agent. They were cleared of all wrongdoing in September after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) withdrew its case. Both men always denied wrongdoing. After weeks of pressure, Mr Parkinson, who is the head of the CPS and director of public prosecutions, has now written a long letter to the national security strategy committee, ahead of appearing before it on Monday. It sets out his account why Mr Cash and Mr Berry were first charged - and how the case then unravelled.

The men were first arrested in March 2023 on suspicion of offences under the Official Secrets Act - and if the case were to go before a jury, the prosecution would have to prove that the defendants had carried out activity ""prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State"". Secondly, a jury would also have to be sure that the UK government had considered between 2021 and 2023 - when the alleged offending occurred - that China was an ""enemy"". Prosecutors concluded that they would need to show a jury that China was an ""enemy"" with the help of expert factual evidence from Matt Collins, the Deputy National Security Adviser (DNSA). As DNSA, Mr Collins is responsible for coming up with an assessment of threats to the UK's national security. He began drafting, with advice from his own lawyers and other officials, a statement which had to be solely focused on the then Conservative government's official and publicly disclosable conclusions about the threat, if any, that China posed. This evidence is separate from any information generated by the intelligence services that remains secret. The eventual statement went into detail about the activities of Chinese intelligence agencies and how they seek to obtain information about the UK's political workings - but the word ""enemy"" was removed by the time a final version was completed in December 2023 and shared with Downing Street. Mr Collins, in his own letter to MPs, said he told police investigating the case he could not call China an ""enemy"" as this ""did not reflect government policy"". In July 2024, a Court of Appeal ruling on the legal definition of enemy, in a separate case concerning Russian interference in the UK, set off alarm bells in the CPS. It underlined the need to provide a jury with a factual account of why a state could be considered an enemy under the Official Secrets Act - and while the government had provided a clear conclusion about Russia, it had not done so for China. In his letter to MPs, Mr Parkinson said that ruling meant the CPS and police had to go back to the DNSA to ask him for more evidence about China. That evidence was essential because prosecutors knew that the defendant's barristers would question whether there was no evidence at all that the UK had regarded China overall as a threat between 2021 and 2023. Former Defence and Home Secretary Grant Shapps said he believes Mr Parkinson felt ""pressurised"" by the Labour government to drop the case because it ""wants warmer relations with Beijing"". ""Anybody who ultimately owes their job to the government and is an appointee will, ultimately take the cues and take prompts from a government policy,"" he told The World Tonight on BBC Radio 4. Shapps also described the DPP's suggestion that the case had collapsed because China had not been called an ""enemy"" by a top security official as ""nonsense"" and ""factually untrue"".

AFP/Getty Images Christopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) both deny the accusation of spying for China

In July, the Director of Public Prosecution's team told the Cabinet Office: ""To prove the oﬀence, the jury would need to be satisfied so that they were sure that, at the material time, China was an enemy. ""That China was an active espionage threat would not be sufficient without examples which adequately demonstrate the nature and extent of the threat, such as to ground a finding that China was an enemy."" That led to two crunch meetings - which led to the case's collapse. At the first meeting on 14 August, Mr Collins told the prosecution team that ""he would not state in evidence, if asked, that China posed a risk to our national security at the material time, either in open Court or in a private session. ""He would also not accept that China was opposed or hostile to the interests of the United Kingdom at the material time,"" says Mr Parkinson's letter. ""He would accept, if asked [at trial], that China was not an enemy in the ordinary meaning of the word, and would not answer the question, if asked, whether China is an enemy within the meaning of the Official Secrets Act. He would say that is a matter for the jury.""

A kilt might not be the first thing on your list when you're a TV superstar packing for an autumnal holiday in Scotland.

Luckily, his hotel's night manager was on hand to give him a loan of his own kilt.

Fallon rose to fame as a cast member on the comedy sketch series Saturday Night Live before becoming the host of a late-night talk show.

The comedian was visiting the River Dee near Balmoral Castle when some members of the King's royal guards, the 5Scots battalion, recognised him and invited him to the Victoria Barracks in Ballater for dinner. The invitation, along with its black-tie dress code, left him with a dilemma - where to get a suit or a kilt, at such short notice. He approached staff at the Fife Arms where he was staying who went the extra mile to help their guest. Fallon said: ""I called the night manager and I talked to him. I said 'I need to get a kilt tonight' and he goes 'I'll figure something out', so Muir gave me his own kilt."" The manager pieced together a full ensemble of kilt, jacket, sporran, hose and brogues.

Bears 'enjoy life to the full' after major rescue

Two bears rescued from ""deplorable conditions"" in Armenia by an East Sussex charity have been making the most of their new lives in a bear sanctuary. Giant Siberian bear Max and Syrian bear Minnie were living in a bus depot for the entertainment of travellers until they were saved in 2018. The rescue operation was carried out by International Animal Rescue (IAR), based in Uckfield, and the Foundation for the Preservation of Wildlife and Cultural Assets in Armenia. Alan Knight, IAR president, told the BBC it was ""heart-warming"" to see how healthy and playful Max and Minnie were ""after years of cruelty and neglect"". ""They are seizing a second chance to enjoy life to the full,"" he added.

International Animal Rescue Max had to be anaesthetised with a blow dart before the rescue crew cut through the bars of the cage using an angle grinder

The IAR said it took a year to persuade the bears' captor to agree to their release. Mr Knight said the pair had been kept in a cage that had been welded shut for more than 10 years. ""Being kept in such a small cage and knee deep in excrement, we couldn't get into the cage to rescue them,"" he said.

International Animal Rescue Keepers say Minnie enjoys apples

As Max weighed 500kg (1,102 lb) he had to be moved in a horse trailer while Minnie was transported on a deep bed of straw in a transport crate. Mr Knight said Max had to be anaesthetised with a blow dart before emergency services cut through the bars of the cage using angle grinders. ""The bears were kept in deplorable conditions and we were desperate to set them free,"" said Mr Knight.

International Animal Rescue Keepers say Max is ""playful"" and ""keeps everyone entertained""

The charity said Max and Minnie have learnt to forage for food hidden in their enclosure in the wildlife rescue centre in Urtsadzor, and are responding to natural bear instincts, including going into hibernation. It adds the bears are regularly treated with fruits, vegetables, fish and meat. The keepers say Max is the ""playful one"", enjoying tree-climbing, tossing logs and balls into the pool and ""keeping everyone entertained"".

Customers at a Lancashire cafe are being offered a 20% discount if they agree to leave their mobiles in a specially built ""phone jail"" during their visit. Usman Hussain, who owns the Chaii Stop on St Paul's Road in Preston, wants the only buzz in his cafe to be that of lively conversations between friends, families and strangers.

West Ham defeat by Leeds marks 'perilous' Hammers' worst start in 52 years,,,"West Ham's miserable Premier League campaign continued with a defeat at Leeds on Friday which ensured their worst start to a season for 52 years.

The result was their third consecuitve defeat under new manager Nuno Espirito Santo, who remains winless since replacing Graham Potter in September.

The Hammers, who sit 19th in the table, have recorded just one win this season and ironically it arrived against Nottingham Forest, when Nuno was in charge at the City Ground.

A dismal return of just four points in total represents West Ham's joint-worst at this stage of a league campaign, with the club replicating that tally in the second tier in 1932-33 and 1973-74, when they finished bottom.

Having been appointed with the task of making sure West Ham don't suffer a relegation that would leave them outside the top flight for the first time since 2011-12, Nuno, who took a point in his first match against Everton, is struggling to find answers.

""There are many problems in our club unfortunately. It is not up to us to hide ourselves behind the problems. Everyone has to be alive and to do much more and be in the right position,"" said the Portuguese.

""We were not dealing with our defensive situations and I felt like we needed a striker to hold the ball, so maybe that's not the greatest from me.

""These kind of mistakes are unacceptable in the Premier League.""

Nuno, also the first West Ham boss to fail to record a win from any of his first four Premier League games since Manuel Pellegrini in September 2018, added: ""There is quality there, there is time, but nothing will happen if we don't change.

""We must change our attitude, we must change the way we approach things, we must commit ourselves better, prepare better, work harder.

Norris and team-mate Oscar Piastri are under pressure from Red Bull's Max Verstappen after a strong run of races for the Dutchman - and the four-time champion topped Friday practice at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.

Verstappen, 40 points off championship leader Piastri after a run of three wins and a second place in the past four races, set the pace, leading Ferrari's Charles Leclerc by 0.153 seconds.

Norris was fourth fastest, while Piastri, 14 points ahead of the Briton, was down in 12th.

Norris, one of nine drivers to miss the first session while handing his car over to a rookie, said: ""We're in a reasonable place, for sure.

""I got up to speed quite quickly, I was quite surprised. I found the limit quickly... but I found the limit quite quickly, which is just holding us back a bit.

""Not that it was a bad day, but normally we're very good on a Friday and then everyone catches up on Saturday.

""We are already a little bit behind so we have definitely some work to do tonight. The balance is a bit all over the place, same as the last few weeks. Single-lap stuff we're struggling a bit at the minute.""

However, although Verstappen was quickest overall, he was also dissatisfied with his day, saying he was struggling for pace on the race-simulation runs later in the session.

""The short run on the soft (tyre) we managed to do a good lap,"" said Verstappen, who has a new floor fitted to his Red Bull as the team chase every last bit of performance. ""The rest, everything else was pretty bad.

""On the medium [tyre], the short run was not great and the big problem was the long run, where we seemed to struggle a lot. That is a big concern for the race.

""The balance wasn't even off. There was just no grip. That is the bigger concern. So, as soon as you go into a sustainable run, the tyres are going hot, we were nowhere, so that is a tough one to sort out, but we'll see.""

When it was pointed out to him that his consolation was that single-lap pace should put him in a good position for qualifying, Verstappen shot back: ""Yeah, but you are not going to win the race like that.

""You can be fast over one lap and if you have zero pace in the race then it is going to be very tough. I prefer to be fast in the race and not so fast over one lap.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/cvgwngjxe4eo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss
Rugby League Ashes: Why Herbie Farnworth could illuminate series for England,,,"Having made the journey from Blacko in Lancashire to the bright lights of Brisbane, England's Herbie Farnworth has emerged as an NRL star in Australia.

As arguably the best centre in the world, he is also the ""cheat code"" England hope can help deliver a first Ashes series victory over the Kangaroos since 1970.

Farnworth is one of six men in Shaun Wane's England squad who play in Australia's premier competition.

And his abilities cannot be underestimated, even as former Australia forward Aaron Woods and other pundits from outside the UK have provided fuel for Wane's squad with withering comments about their quality.

A key member of the side who reached the World Cup semi-final in 2022, Farnworth was named as one of the two Dally M centres of the year in both 2023 and 2024 and was instrumental in England's 2-0 win over Samoa 12 months ago - scoring three tries and emerging as the series' top metre maker.

During 2025, Farnworth exhibited his class for the Dolphins, as he crossed for 12 tries in 19 appearances until a hamstring injury ended his season in early August and affected the Queensland side's push for the finals.

Wane has repeatedly referred to him as ""one of the best centres in the world"", a view endorsed by England captain George Williams, who looks set to be a club-mate of Farnworth's in the near future.

""Herbie is unbelievable,"" said the England stand-off. ""He is one of the best players in the world at the minute. He is a cheat code playing in the NRL so we welcome him into our team with open arms.

""He creates something from nothing. He's a good lad too, who I have known for a long time. He kills it in the NRL.

""In the last series we played against Samoa, it was like he was playing a different game to anyone else. He was just running through like he was playing under-sevens.""

Gold Coast Titans back AJ Brimson, who is a newcomer to Wane's squad added: ""In my opinion, he was the best centre [in the NRL] this year.

""He has been the Dally M centre the last two years and missed out this year by a smidge and I thought this was his best year at centre. He's in fine form and is someone I am looking forward to playing with.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/articles/cy8v3gpjndro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss
Track Cycling World Championships: Josh Tarling and Josh Charlton wins golds for Great Britain,,,"Josh Tarling and Josh Charlton won gold medals for Great Britain at the Track World Championships.

Tarling delivered a first British gold of the championship in Chile by winning the men's points race, amassing 750 points over the 40km event to beat American Peter Moore (675) to the title.

Charlton, 22, then doubled the gold tally, winning GB's first world title in the individual pursuit since Bradley Wiggins in 2008.

A good start saw 21-year-old Tarling take points in the opening sprint, then secure maximum points in sprint three before he powered clear to gain a lap.

That gave him the lead and he continued to accumulate points, including the maximum again in sprint 11, to win gold in style.

Track Worlds debutant Tarling becomes the first British man to win the points race title since Jonathan Dibben in 2016.

""I didn't know how [my first World Championships] would be or how it would feel , so not knowing was scary,"" Tarling said.

""It felt pretty good. I think it was good that I got those early points in so I knew the legs were there.""

Charlton, who took silver on his championships debut last year, dominated this time around as he upgraded to gold - finishing more than three seconds clear of Denmark's Rasmus Pederson.

Elsewhere, Joe Truman took bronze in the men's 1km time trial - behind the Dutch duo of Harrie Lavreysen and Jeffrey Hoogland - to match his achievement from 12 months ago.

Britain's overall medal tally is now up to seven after three days of action.

Katie Archibald won silver in the women's elimination race, while GB claimed women's team pursuit bronze on Thursday, having secured silver medals in both the men's and women's team sprints on the opening day.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/articles/cgjd876364zo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss
MLB World Series Game 1: Toronto Blue Jays beat LA Dodgers 11-4,,,"Addison Barger smashed the first grand slam by a pinch-hitter in World Series history as the Toronto Blue Jays blew away the Los Angeles Dodgers in the first game of the 'Fall Classic'.

With an expectant crowd packed into Toronto's Rogers Centre for the first World Series game in Canada since 1993, the Blue Jays scored nine runs in the bottom of the sixth inning as they romped to an 11-4 win.

Not even a home run from Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani could spare the defending champions' blushes as their American League opponents drew first blood in the best-of-seven series.

The Dodgers took an early lead as Enrique Hernandez drove in Teoscar Hernandez in the second inning, before Will Smith did the same for Mookie Betts in the third.

But Toronto's Daulton Varsho tied the game at 2-2 with a two-run homer to centre field in the bottom of the fourth.

The sixth-inning blowout came when Dodgers starting pitcher Blake Snell was taken out after hitting Varsho with a pitch to load the bases with no outs.

Ernie Clement singled off reliever Emmet Sheehan to give Toronto the lead for he first time, Sheehan walked in a run, and a line drive from Andres Gimenez made it 5-2.

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts then replaced Sheehan with Anthony Banda on the mound, but it backfired spectacularly as Barger's grand slam cleared the bases, before Alejandro Kirk added a two-run homer of his own to make it 11-2.

Ohtani served notice of his ability with a two-run shot in the seventh, but it was too little, too late for the National League champions .

Toronto had attempted to sign Ohtani, external before he moved across LA from the Angels to the Dodgers, but the home fans chanted ""We don't need him!"" as he came up to bat again in the ninth.

Game two takes place on Saturday evening, also in Toronto, before the series switches to Los Angeles.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/baseball/articles/cvgm74045mro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss
Harlequins Women 52-42 Loughborough Lightning: Ellie Kildunne returns in PWR thriller,,,"It hasn't even been a month since the Red Roses triumphed over Canada in the World Cup final at Twickenham.

But three of the brightest stars from that side were on show in what was an amazing advert for the PWR, including world player of the year Kildunne.

The England full-back wasn't as central to Quins' success as she so often has been.

But her name brought up the loudest cheer as the teams were read out before the game and there were some jinking trademark runs from deep, as well as a neat pass to assist a vital try for Lauren Torley to score in the corner and give the hosts the lead for the first time in the match.

Club and country team-mate Lucy Packer was as dependable as ever at scrum-half.

Loughborough flanker Kabeya played an instrumental part in the game's opening try, charging through three challenges before she was eventually taken down, leaving Bo Westcombe-Evans free to score unchallenged.

She then got her name on the scoresheet in the second half to cap a fine return for the visitors.

Loughborough captain Daisy Hibbert-Jones described Kabeya as ""vital"" to the team when speaking to BBC Sport.

""She's a physical freak. Both sides of the ball, she's a hugely attacking threat, she's got power, she's got pace to get her through those line breaks.

""And defensively she's an absolute physical warrior. She's someone I love to play alongside and would hate to play against.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cn8xv610ey0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

How Giorgia Meloni became Trump's best friend in Europe,,,"Available for over a year

Giorgia Meloni is Italy’s first female Prime Minister, and her political star has risen rapidly - from working class roots in Rome, to becoming one of the most important and divisive leaders in Europe. A populist whose party has roots in Italian fascism, and who takes a hard right stance on migration and family values, she has formed a kinship with Donald Trump, who this month alone has promoted her autobiography and her speeches online, and called her “beautiful” on stage. In today’s episode, journalist Barbara Serra joins us to discuss Meloni’s increasingly crucial role in US-European relations.
